Provides single sign-on service for Wild Apricot members to provide access to restricted Wild Apricot content.

== Description ==

The [Wild Apricot](http://www.wildapricot.com/) Login plugin allows you to restrict content on your WordPress to your Wild Apricot members, and provide access to restricted Wild Apricot content such as member directories and member-only events. Any restricted Wild Apricot content - embedded using Wild Apricot widgets - can be accessed without further authentication. 

You can display a login button for single sign-on by adding a widget - installed along with the Wild Apricot Login plugin - to the header in your WordPress theme layout, or by inserting a shortcode in your page content. A shortcode can be added to a WordPress page to restrict WordPress content to Wild Apricot members. As well, you can use the plugin to add Wild Apricot membership levels as WordPress roles.
